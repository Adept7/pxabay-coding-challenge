# pxabay-coding-challenge
This is an example of a test task for an interview

## Possible improvements:
- Add pagination to the list of pictures
- Add unit tests
- Improve the application theme and write separate styles for the toolbar and other commonly used elements
- Add [TextUtils](https://github.com/Adept7/pxabay-coding-challenge/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/com/shevel/pixabaychallenge/utils/StringUtils.kt) file to DI so that you do not need to pass **resources** every time
- Add check for incorrect data
- Add **empty_screen** if no pictures were found
- Add check for no internet
- It would also be nice to add three layers of data and **UseCases** to follow the **Clean Architecture**
